  abstractnote = {Thyroid nodules are a frequent finding on neck sonography. Most nodules are benign; therefore, many nodules are biopsied to identify the small number that are malignant or require surgery for a definitive diagnosis. Since 2009, many professional societies and investigators have proposed ultrasound-based risk stratification systems to identify nodules that warrant biopsy or sonographic follow-up. Because some of these systems were founded on the BI-RADS® classification that is widely used in breast imaging, their authors chose to apply the acronym TI-RADS, for Thyroid Imaging, Reporting and Data System. In 2012, the ACR convened committees to (1) provide recommendations for reporting incidental thyroid nodules, (2) develop a set of standard terms (lexicon) for ultrasound reporting, and (3) propose a TI-RADS on the basis of the lexicon. The committees published the results of the first two efforts in 2015. In this article, the authors present the ACR TI-RADS Committee’s recommendations, which provide guidance regarding management of thyroid nodules on the basis of their ultrasound appearance. The authors also describe the committee’s future directions.},

  abstractnote = {Ultrasound is the most commonly used imaging technique for the evaluation of thyroid nodules. Sonographic findings are often not specific, and definitive diagnosis is usually made through fine-needle aspiration biopsy or even surgery. In reviewing the literature, terms used to describe nodules are often poorly defined and inconsistently applied. Several authors have recently described a standardized risk stratification system called the Thyroid Imaging, Reporting and Data System (TIRADS), modeled on the BI-RADS system for breast imaging. However, most of these TIRADS classifications have come from individual institutions, and none has been widely adopted in the United States. Under the auspices of the ACR, a committee was organized to develop TIRADS. The eventual goal is to provide practitioners with evidence-based recommendations for the management of thyroid nodules on the basis of a set of well-defined sonographic features or terms that can be applied to every lesion. Terms were chosen on the basis of demonstration of consistency with regard to performance in the diagnosis of thyroid cancer or, conversely, classifying a nodule as benign and avoiding follow-up. The initial portion of this project was aimed at standardizing the diagnostic approach to thyroid nodules with regard to terminology through the development of a lexicon. This white paper describes the consensus process and the resultant lexicon.},

  abstractnote = {In 2017, the Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) Committee of the American College of Radiology (ACR) published a white paper that presented a new risk-stratification system for classifying thyroid nodules on the basis of their appearance at ultrasonography (US). In ACR TI-RADS, points in five feature categories are summed to determine a risk level from TR1 to TR5. Recommendations for biopsy or US follow-up are based on the nodule’s ACR TI-RADS level and its maximum diameter. The purpose of this article is to offer practical guidance on how to implement and apply ACR TI-RADS based on the authors’ experience with the system. © RSNA, 2018.},
